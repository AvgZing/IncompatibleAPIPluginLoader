# IncompatibleAPIPluginLoader

IncompatibleAPIPluginLoader is, just like the name indicates, a plugin to load plugins that failed loading due to the API version being incompatible. This allows older plugins to be loaded and enabled.<br>

### PLEASE NOTE...
- IncompatibleAPIPluginLoader is NOT responsible for any damage done using loaded plugins with an outdated API version.
- IncompatibleAPIPluginLoader does NOT magically fix outdated plugins. It only loads plugins of outdated API versions.
